 * Explanation:
 * 
 * the event is initially not yet happened, so the function must return false
 * until the cyclic timer goes true for a cycle: at this point the behaviour
 * alternates three cycles of true (one because triggered by cyclicTimer,
 * two additional for the limited memory) and three cycles of false
 * (the cyclic timer is not switching, and the memory is finished).
