Protelis-lang conventions
=========================

* All functions **must** be tested.
* Every test should begin with the name of the tested function.
* Be as generic as possible. Use high-order function wherever possible.
* Follow [Java's code convention](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconventions-139411.html) when possible
* Add javadoc to every `public` function.
* When a function is called by another function, the called function's parameters follow the caller's parameters.
